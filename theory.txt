                                                                  the theroy of infinity 
                                                                               of the student 
 scene 1 

a boy named krishna was joined in a school name titan english medium school at that time he was 13 years old he went to the school as a hostler there the carreer of this is started 
he loves painting and drawing he was very fascinate of learning new thing like (experiments all science stuff) his parents wanted him ton crack iit jee but he want to learn every thing pratical and experiments  on the way go he was intersted in knowing  histroies and general knowlegde he was he wanted to learn  both simultanuoeusly but he meet both ends unfortunately the studies graph goes down
as soon as he reached 10th he started looking around world he was feeling nervous for every situation the fear of exams and words of people make him very nervous 
he wasted his valuable time in intermediate and he become an slow learner failed in the jee his parents feel bad but they didnt express this boy is an innovert  he fail to express his feelings  the people arounnd him make so fun of his situation indireectly he lost his mental stability most of the time he was with the boooks as a book worm but he bearly reember want he read  he was not at all good in sports his friends didnt allow him to joinn any team as he was bad in sports he has learned and intersted in playing badminaton  but very less people play tennnis so he has no luck in playing 
 he entered engneering  he started thinking who iam i wha t is my purpose of life what is the talent i have he was feeling bad about the born talent (drawing) that he had missed he wanted to restart his career bring real values to his life 


scence 2;


he started thinkiing where we are come from it all started with the natural seclection   basically the cell is the one main reason where life is started according to the natural selection one can survive on earth by following natural selection 
this can be explained by a simple girafe example that short necked girffa is completing with other animal to eat food they developed their long nnecked dna to thier offspring  the next genration animals of their kind increse the height the is all posssible by cell division 
  do you know why some boby bulider beat by themselves to become strong     
   tearing of muscles leads to new growth of the muscle that leds cell repair(tissue damage repair )


ever wonder why we only got evoluted repect of other animal ?
 this is becomes we firsted ruleing since we are born (hunting ,making dogs and other animals  as salves )
  why iam saying this means monkeys behaviour over the enivornment leds to homosapeins  the end of evolution  of animals speices
  homo sapeins humans 
sooner we started worshiping the nature and begining of killing of  nature of also started by this milesstone we become dominater of all speices  

what if animals other than humans are evolved 

every living  being in this planet has very special abilietes
elephannt (strong)
bull (strength)
cow(medial)
plant (medial resucer(oxygen))
tiger  (brave )
peacock (dance)
dog (honesty )
crane (semiperable membrane )
lion (power in this feast )
cheetah (fast 70 km/hr)
ant (planing)
insects(plants growth (nitrogen ),(seed scattering ))

etc 
all have unique and special ablity 
all animal  except humans can predict weather enivorment around them
our unique feaure is complex brain  
i wanted to started research all where single field that i can study
do you ever  know where
the beginning of the cell happpened  
still  it is a mystery   all the particles are come from from an single atom hydrogen (sun) we all don t know the begoining of the universe  but the most  popular theory thAt satisfy the lawas govened by the nature is big bang thorey stefpen hawking  explained about after the big bang in very accurately based on laws governesd by  naturre 
they are three fundmaental laws of nature they are 
every action has an equal and opposite reaction 
always there will be force developed by moving mass in with changeing magnetic field 
the body will be in contiinouus motion  until any external force acts on it  (interia )
no one in the world or in the universe can predict the furture but we can  predicst the probality of occurance 
 this why identical experiaments need not give identical results   this leds to development of quantam mechanics  where classical mechanices (laws of thermmodyanics , laws of gravity ) 
can not justifty 
 they  are some mystries that are neirther satifies classical mechanics nor quatam mechannics indiviuallly that is why einstein worked in his last days inventing unifed theory  

this all these laws  are created to understand the behaviour of nature 
quantam mechanics (finding the properties of occurance it is like  complex form)
classical as real number form    according to hawking all started with  singuality (infinite density ) 
after the big bang the temperature of the universe is around billllon millon kelvins  after  1sec the temperature fall around milllon after the time pass universe is expanding  gravity ooppoes this motion if expanding is apporamate 1/10^16 more than the orignal expanding   big rip takes place 
iF contrating is is apporamate 1/10^16 more than original then singuularity rebuild  there is an unknown force that balaned these both forcees and stoped the consequnences calll dark energy  there is no  scientific proof of dark energy but this energy is governing the universe the whole  maths in governing laws of nature can be channged by this dark energy 
according to hawking total energy  of the universe is zero 
according to him all energy come from vaccum pulse (vaccum means not nothinng there willl always a continous divisoion of particle and antipaarticle and there willl always a continous combining  of particle and antipaarticle) 

due to   particle  matter is created the energy is asscioated with that particle 
4 pillar of science 
1) electrostatic force
2) stronng nuclear force
3) weak nuclear force 
4) gravitional force

these 4  pilllars can be reprented in mathametics as 137 it is send as signal to foreginer spieces as we are there in this planet 
if one pillar is wrong entire laws are wrong 

Scene 3: The Turning Point
Krishna immersed himself in the study of these profound scientific concepts. His curiosity and desire to understand the mysteries of the universe rekindled his passion for learning. He spent countless hours reading about quantum mechanics, the theory of relativity, and the origins of life. Despite his previous struggles, he began to find solace in the complexities of science.

One day, while reading a paper on dark energy and the mysteries of the universe, Krishna had an epiphany. He realized that his true passion lay not just in understanding the universe, but in sharing that knowledge with others. He decided to start a blog to explain complex scientific concepts in a simple and engaging way, hoping to inspire others who, like him, had struggled with traditional education.

Scene 4: Sharing the Knowledge
Krishna's blog, "The Infinite Quest," quickly gained popularity. His unique way of explaining difficult concepts in an easy-to-understand manner resonated with many readers. He used his artistic skills to create diagrams and illustrations that made his explanations even clearer. His parents, initially disappointed by his academic failures, began to see his potential and supported his new venture.

As his blog grew, Krishna was invited to speak at schools and conferences. He found that he had a natural talent for teaching and inspiring others. His journey from a struggling student to a passionate educator became a story of hope and perseverance.

Scene 5: The Unexpected Discovery
One night, while working on a new blog post about the origins of the universe, Krishna received an email from a renowned scientist, Dr. Meera Iyer. She had been following his blog and was impressed by his insights and passion. She invited him to join a research team at a prestigious institute to work on a groundbreaking project related to dark energy.

Krishna was overjoyed. This was the opportunity he had been waiting for â€“ a chance to contribute to real scientific research. He accepted the offer and moved to the institute. There, he met brilliant minds from around the world, and for the first time, he felt truly at home.

Scene 6: The Breakthrough
The research team was investigating a mysterious signal that seemed to come from deep space. They believed it might be a message from an advanced civilization. Krishna's unique perspective and fresh ideas played a crucial role in decoding the signal. After months of intense work, they made a startling discovery: the signal was a mathematical representation of a new type of energy, which they named "Ethereon."

Ethereon had properties that defied the known laws of physics. It seemed to bridge the gap between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics, potentially offering a unified theory of everything. The discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community.

Scene 7: The Revelation
As the team delved deeper into the nature of Ethereon, they made an even more astonishing discovery. The properties of Ethereon suggested that the universe was not a random occurrence but a highly sophisticated simulation. The signal they had received was a message from the creators of this simulation, inviting humanity to join them in understanding the true nature of existence.

Krishna was stunned. The revelation was beyond anything he had ever imagined. The universe, life, and everything he had studied were part of an elaborate design. The implications were profound, raising questions about free will, the nature of reality, and humanity's place in the cosmos.

Scene 8: The New Beginning
With this new knowledge, Krishna and the research team embarked on a journey to explore the boundaries of this simulated universe. They developed new technologies to interact with the creators, seeking answers to the fundamental questions of existence. Krishna's blog, now more popular than ever, became a platform for discussing these groundbreaking discoveries and their philosophical implications.

In the end, Krishna's journey from a struggling student to a pioneer in understanding the true nature of the universe showed that the quest for knowledge is infinite, and every setback is just a step toward a greater discovery.
