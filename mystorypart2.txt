The Last war
Suddenly, I woke up, startled by an eerie silence. My instincts kicked in, and I quickly roused the other crew members. We were disoriented, unable to recognize our surroundings. To maintain a pressure balance between our crew module and the outer environment, we released pressure from the module. I volunteered to step out first, and after thorough checks, I confirmed the pressure was stable, identical to Earth’s.

As I ventured outside, a wave of disbelief washed over me. All the signs were in Sanskrit. Being the only Indian in the crew, I could read and understand the language. My heart raced as I deciphered the messages on the boards—it was a shock beyond comprehension. We had somehow been transported to the era of the Mahabharata.

Our crew module had crash-landed, its outer shell completely destroyed, leaving us stranded in the midst of a dense jungle. Despite the dire situation, excitement bubbled within me. I was on the brink of witnessing the legendary events of the Mahabharata unfold before my eyes.

As we made our way through the jungle, I saw chariots approaching, surrounded by numerous kings' guards. They were chanting, "Suyodhana! Suyodhana!" It took a moment, but I realized they were referring to Duryodhana. My mind raced back to the bedtime stories my grandmother had told me about the Mahabharata. This was real, and I was living it.

I told my crew members what I had seen. Strangely, I glimpsed myself standing near a tree, but then I disappeared. I explained everything to my crew, reassuring them that I knew the story of Mahabharata in great detail. We decided to head to Hastinapur, the heart of the Kaurava kingdom.

Upon reaching Hastinapur, we saw the majestic palace of the king. We gathered information from the locals and quickly learned that Duryodhana was preparing for war against the Pandavas. I taught my fellow crew members Sanskrit, allowing us to blend in and gather more intelligence.

The entire kingdom was abuzz with fear and anticipation. The battle of Kurukshetra was just two days away. I was both anxious and exhilarated—soon, I would witness the most epic war in history. Using parts from our damaged crew module, I managed to build a spy drone equipped with a camera and microphone. Over the next two days, we observed the people's suffering under Duryodhana's rule. They were fervently praying to Lord Rama for deliverance. One evening, amidst the smoke of prayer, I once again saw myself, only to disappear once more.

The War Begins
Day 1: The War Commences
The battlefield came alive with the sound of clashing weapons. Bhishma, the grand patriarch of the Kauravas, led their forces with unmatched expertise. His vast military knowledge and strategic brilliance initially gave the Kauravas an edge. Arjuna, the mightiest warrior of the Pandavas, hesitated to face Bhishma, whom he revered. But Krishna, his charioteer and guide, urged him on, reminding him of his duty.

Days 2 and 3: The Tide Turns
The Pandavas, regrouping with renewed vigor, launched a powerful counterattack. Bhishma, relentless in his assault, inflicted heavy casualties, pushing the Pandavas to their limits.

Day 4: Arjuna’s Vow
In a moment of intense resolve, Arjuna vowed to defeat Bhishma by the next day or take his own life. This vow demonstrated his unwavering commitment to his mission, even as the battle revealed the limits and potential of their weapons.

Day 5: Bhishma Wounds Krishna
Bhishma’s prowess on the battlefield continued to dominate, but Bhima made significant advances, using unconventional tactics.

Day 6: Bhishma’s Dominance
Bhishma’s superiority was undeniable. His relentless attacks tested the Pandavas’ endurance, forcing them to explore new strategies.

Day 7: The Pandavas Struggle
Bhishma’s strategies kept the Pandavas on the defensive. Bhima, however, struck a devastating blow by killing seventeen of Duryodhana’s brothers, highlighting the personal vendettas fueling the conflict.

Day 8: Bhima’s Vengeance
The intensity of the battle escalated as Bhima continued his assault on Duryodhana’s brothers. Both sides employed every tactic and strategy at their disposal.

Day 10: Bhishma’s Fall
Krishna devised a cunning plan involving Shikhandi, whose presence forced Bhishma to lower his weapons. This psychological maneuver led to Bhishma’s fall, a turning point in the war.

The War’s Turning Points
Day 11: Drona Takes Command
Drona, the new commander of the Kauravas, brought fresh strategies to the battlefield. His focus on capturing Yudhishthira marked a shift towards more targeted operations.

Day 12: The Chakravyuha Formation
Drona’s creation of the Chakravyuha, a complex military formation, presented a significant challenge. Abhimanyu, Arjuna’s son, knew how to penetrate it but lacked the strategy to exit, leading to his tragic death.

Day 13: Jayadratha’s Vow
Arjuna vowed to kill Jayadratha before sunset. The Kauravas employed intricate defensive strategies to protect him, but Arjuna, with Krishna’s guidance, ultimately succeeded.

Day 14: The Battle Intensifies
Ghatotkacha, Bhima’s son, used guerrilla tactics to strike fear into the Kauravas. Karna, forced to use his most powerful weapon, inflicted significant damage.

Day 15: Drona’s Death
A deceptive strategy led Drona to believe his son, Ashwatthama, was dead. In his grief, he laid down his weapons, and Dhrishtadyumna fulfilled his vow by killing Drona.

Day 16: Karna Takes Command
Karna, the new Kaurava commander, faced Arjuna in a fierce battle. Despite his skill, Karna’s chariot wheel got stuck, leading to his downfall.

Day 17: Karna’s Death
In a decisive battle, Karna’s chariot was immobilized. Krishna reminded Arjuna of Karna’s past misdeeds, prompting Arjuna to deliver the fatal blow.

Day 18: The Final Confrontation
Duryodhana, the last of the Kauravas, was defeated in a brutal mace fight with Bhima, marking the end of the war.

The Aftermath
Ashwatthama’s Revenge
Ashwatthama, driven by rage, killed the Pandavas’ sons while they slept. His act of treachery highlighted the moral complexities of war.

Bhishma’s Final Moments
As Bhishma lay on his bed of arrows, he waited for the sun to transition to the northern hemisphere (Uttarayana) before departing, symbolizing the end of an era.

The Reality of the Mahabharata
The reality I witnessed was starkly different from the dramatic tales told in the Mahabharata. Lord Krishna appeared as a mortal man, The much-celebrated divine interventions, like the display of the Dashavataram, were not happened in real life. The so-called “unlimited” arrows of Arjuna were actually replenished by an army of servants. And the Hanuman flag on Arjuna’s chariot was just that—a flag.they feel it protects Chariot.

As the war unfolded, I realized that the people of this time were incredibly strong and fit. Even Shakuni, the devious mastermind, was a formidable figure. The attire of the people was identical to the images we see today. Krishna, with his skin as dark as a rain cloud, was a towering figure, standing at seven feet tall. I traveled to Dwarka with him, witnessing firsthand the life and times of this ancient civilization.

In Dwarka, I crafted an idol of Krishna and embedded a time capsule within it—a specimen detailing the exact time and location of the Mahabharata war, along with a magnet that would guide future generations to this knowledge. Two of my crew members, Jesus and Mohammed, left to explore the origins of their religions. Jesus later inscribed the complete formula for time travel within the pyramids of Egypt.

I foresaw a tsunami that would devastate Dwarka. I warned Krishna, who, with his unparalleled wisdom, managed to evacuate most of the people. However, some remained behind, and Krishna met his end in the chaos.

As for my crew, they succumbed to diseases, leaving me as the last survivor. Now, at 91 years old, I hold onto these memories, knowing they will resurface one day.

The Rediscovery
In 1983, the ancient city of Dwarka was rediscovered by marine archaeologist Dr. S.R. Rao. Among the ruins, he found an idol of Krishna with inscriptions in my handwriting. The language had evolved, and it would take centuries to decrypt my message.

But when someone finally comes close to unlocking the truth, I believe I will reappear, just as I had vanished before, ready to guide those who seek the knowledge I left behind.
