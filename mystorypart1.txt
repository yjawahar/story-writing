Childhood Dreams and Family Bonds
From a young age, I dreamed of becoming a scientist, the kind who unlocks the mysteries of the universe. I was blessed with a loving family, surrounded by both maternal and paternal grandparents who showered me with affection. Every summer, my heart would race with excitement as I packed my bags to visit my maternal grandmother's village, a place filled with laughter, games, and the smell of home-cooked meals.

My maternal grandmother was the light of my life. We spent countless hours playing Ashta Chamma and carrom board, her laughter echoing through the house. She was a woman of generous proportions, but despite her weight, she ate like a bird. My maternal grandfather, a man who elebrates every little occasion with chocolates, cakes, and toys  was my maternal grandfather . Life was smooth sailing, a perfect picture of happiness.

The Shadow of Illness
But as the saying goes, "into every life, a little rain must fall." Our happiness was shattered when my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with diabetes, a result of her weight. My maternal grandfather, too, fell victim to diabetes due to his love for sweets. Things took a darker turn when my grandmother developed kidney complications from the diabetes. One fateful day, she slipped on the floor, and the fall injured her spine, leaving her bedridden for years.

Her recovery was slow, and just as we thought she was on the mend, another setback hit us. Due to a doctor's negligence, she was prescribed the wrong medication, which led to kidney failure. It was a painful lesson: never blindly follow a doctor's prescription. Always ask about the complications and share your complete medical history. Diabetes is a silent killer, and its complications are life-threatening.

My (m)grandmother's health deteriorated rapidly, and her last wish was to see my sister getting married. Through it all, my paternal grandmother stood like a rock, supporting our family. Despite everyone's efforts, my maternal grandmother passed away due to multiple organ failure but her last wish was not fulfilled. Her death left a gaping hole in our lives, a void that seemed impossible to fill. My mother worked tirelessly day and night to care for her, and her loss was a blow that took us years to recover from.

Finding Strength in Family
My maternal grandfather, devastated by the loss of his wife, found it hard to move on. My paternal grandfather tried his best to help him find solace, but the sorrow lingered. These two men, my maternal and paternal grandfathers, were the torchbearers of our family, guiding the younger generation with wisdom and love. The loss of my maternal grandmother took its toll, and eventually, my maternal grandfather succumbed to the complications of diabetes. It took us many years to come to terms with their passing, but the sweet memories of my grandfather's life remain, stories I now share with the younger generation.

A New Chapter: The Rise of AI and a Scientist's Dream
In my second year of engineering at a local college, a revolution was brewing in the world of technology. On November 30, 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT to the public, marking a significant milestone in artificial intelligence. Founded by visionaries like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman, OpenAI was paving the way for the future. I was fascinated by their work and became determined to be a part of it.

At the age of 22, I landed a job at a reputable company and became a pillar of support for my family. I was proud to pay for my sister's wedding, a joyous occasion funded entirely by my salary. My fascination with AI grew, and I began to explore how I could create my own version of ChatGPT, one that could learn and correct itself with minimal input from users.

The Dawn of a New Era: AGI and Neuralink
By 2025, Neuralink had successfully implanted chips in 1,000 patients, helping paralysis patients regain control of their bodies and offering hope to those with severe brain diseases. Elon Musk's vision was becoming a reality. The first successful human trial in August 2024 received widespread acclaim, paving the way for further research.

In 2030, the world witnessed a groundbreaking achievement: the creation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by Elon Musk and Sam Altman. This breakthrough led to disruptions across industries and the creation of new jobs. SpaceX once again rose to prominence as the largest space organization, solidifying the United States' power.

A Leap Through Time
The fascination with time led to an unexpected collaboration between Elon Musk and physicist Ronald Mallett. Together, they ventured into the realm of time travel, using AGI to analyze every compound on Earth. By 2035, they had created a time travel rocket based on the principles of curving space-time. Their first test, sending an animal one year into the future, was a success. Encouraged by this, they began recruiting time travel astronauts from around the world.

I was captivated by the prospect and decided to apply. Out of millions of applicants, I made it through the initial rounds thanks to my background as an assistant researcher. I had written to countless researchers during my engineering days, seeking opportunities to learn, and one had taken me under his wing. This experience paid off, and I advanced through the rigorous selection process, from completing challenging courses to undergoing physical training. Eventually, I found myself among the final 20 candidates.

The Final Countdown
Only three of us were chosen for the actual time travel mission, and to my immense pride, I was the first Indian among them. We underwent intense training, preparing for the journey of a lifetime. The day finally arrived, and as we stood before the time machine, the interviewer asked us why we wanted to time travel. Our answers were the same: we wanted to rescue our families from the tragedies we had faced.

As the countdown began, my heart pounded with anticipation. At the count of zero, there was a sudden explosion. In an instant, we three vanished, leaving behind only a cloud of ash. The scientists were left in shock, unable to determine if we had successfully traveled through time or if we had simply been reduced to ashes. The fund managers hesitated to invest further, having already spent a staggering 1,000 crore on research.

The Unanswered Question
Were we pioneers of time travel, or had we met our end in a fiery explosion? The world may never know.
maybe, just maybe, the answer lies waiting to be discovered, somewhere in the future.
